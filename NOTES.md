# Notes between sessions

## Session 1 — 2026-10-11 — milestone 0: first something

What I did:

- `git init`, then built the whole of milestone 0: `tools/midi.mjs` (my own MIDI
  file reader), `tools/midi2json.mjs` (MIDI → note data), `index.html` +
  `src/{pieces,audio,visual,main}.js`, and released `0.0.1`.
- Converted BWV 565 only: 3651 notes, 9m32s, three voices (right hand 1905,
  left hand 1417, pedal 329), widest sounding chord 9 notes. `data/` holds the
  JSON plus a generated `.js` copy (see the file:// note below).
- The organ: two oscillators per note (a second pipe a hair flat, at 0.32),
  a normalised eight-harmonic stop mix, four slightly different stop mixes picked
  per note, a 5.2 Hz tremulant plus a slow air modulation, a 2.2 s noise impulse
  response as the room, and a lowpass at 6.2 kHz. Notes are handed over 0.35 s
  ahead (`LOOKAHEAD`) of the audio clock, so stop silences in a third of a second.
- Loudness by numbers: one note peaks at `0.5 / busiest moment` ≈ 0.056 for this
  piece, times about 1.3 with the second pipe, so nine notes peak near 0.7 and
  `VOLUME` 0.8 puts that under a limiter at -3 dB. The limiter is deliberately
  lazy so a soft verse stays soft.
- The visual: notes fall at 62 px/s toward a "line of sound" at 72% height, x =
  pitch across the piece's own range, colour per voice, a flare as a note crosses,
  trails from a 0.26 alpha fade, small marks at every C, a slow halo grown by how
  many notes are sounding.
- Wrote the release menu at `releases/index.html`. It reads `releases.js`, which
  `tools/release.sh` now writes next to `releases.json`.
- 14 tests pass (`node --test`).

Decisions worth keeping:

- **No ES modules, no fetch in the page.** A page opened straight from disk cannot
  `fetch()` a `.json` file and will not load `type="module"` scripts. So the page
  is classic scripts around a `window.Bach` global, and the converter also emits
  `data/<slug>.js`, which is the same JSON wrapped as
  `window.BachData[slug] = …` and loaded with a `<script>` tag. The `.json` is
  the real file: tests read it, the `.js` is generated and byte-checked against it.
  If a future session adds a file the page needs, generate a `.js` wrapper too
  rather than reaching for fetch.
- Note rows are arrays in the order named by the JSON `format` field
  (`voice, pitch, time, duration, velocity`), which keeps BWV 565 at 110 KB
  instead of 250 KB. `organ.prepare()` turns rows into objects once.
- The page does the display naming (`src/pieces.js`): the MIDI track names are
  "RH:1", "LH:" and "". The data file keeps the raw name.

Things that surprised me:

- LilyPond repeats the same tempo mark dozens of times; the reader drops a mark
  that repeats the tempo already in force, and marks at one tick keep file order.
- These MIDI files carry no dynamics at all: every velocity is 90/127 = 0.7087.
  The page cannot borrow expression from the file, so it will have to shape its
  own (by register, by texture, by section) when the playing gets more subtle.
- The 565 edition here ends the Fugue on D minor (D2 D3 F3 A3) — no Picardy
  third. That is the source, not a conversion bug. Do not "fix" it.
- **BWV 582 needs a decision before it is converted.** Its 9 tracks include
  tracks 5, 6 and 7 holding the same line simultaneously at three octaves
  (48/36/60 offset, 856 notes each), and track 4 duplicating track 3 twelve
  semitones higher for the first half. Playing every track would sound like a
  stacked-octave drone. Check against the score which track is the real one (or
  add a doubling rule) in that session — this is milestone 1's first job.
- `test/page.test.mjs` runs the four page scripts against a fake DOM, canvas and
  Web Audio, because there is no browser here. It found a real bug at once (the
  organ built its stop mixes but never called `makeWaves`, so pipes got
  `undefined` waves). It checks: every oscillator gets started, envelope points
  are in time order, colours handed to the canvas are parseable, everything is
  wired to the destination, nothing is drawn off screen, and pipe start times
  match the note times to within 8 ms.

Next, in order:

1. Milestone 1: decide the BWV 582 doubling, convert the other three pieces, and
   make `test/data.test.mjs` cover all of them (it already checks every
   `data/*.json` against its MIDI file).
2. A way to choose the piece — the list already builds itself from
   `Bach.pieces`, so it is mostly a naming/colour entry per piece.
3. Pause, restart, and clicking anywhere on the progress to move into the piece.
   `organ.play(prepared, from)` already takes a start point; the visual resets
   itself when time jumps backwards.
4. A fuller organ: more pipes per note, and dynamics drawn from the music rather
   than the flat velocities. Also consider reverb that changes with the section.
5. Only then milestone 2 looks per piece.
